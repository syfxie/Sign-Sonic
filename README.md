# Sign Sonic

For over 500 000 people in North America, American Sign Language (ASL) is their natural language. Yet, ASL is also foreign to over 95% of the population. This becomes a major barrier for individuals with hearing loss or speech impairments. Their access to socialization, education, and even services like healthcare are restricted due to the lack of accurate, real-time translation services.

Sign Sonic is an American Sign Language (ASL) to English translator with support for both real-time and pre-recorded video translations. This project aims to bridge the communication gap by providing easy-to-access, real-time translations that facilitate everyday conversation.

## Features
1. Collects full body/face/hand keypoint data from a sequence of actions, and uses a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model to generate translations.
2. Point your phone camera at the individual signing, and read real-time translations of your screen
3. Use Sign Sonic with video calling apps like Zoom and Microsoft Teams for live subtitle-generation
4. Generate English transcripts from videos of signers
